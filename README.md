## Assignment 2 for the course Advanced Cognitive Modeling!
### by Kasper Michelsen, Kathrine Schultz-Nielsen, Kristian Severin Mengel-Niemann, and Mia Jacobsen
This assignment simulates two different agents playing the matching pennies game against a random opponent with a bias – an LSWS agent and a memory agent with confidence. A model for each agent is then implemented on the simulated data, and the quality of the models is assessed using prior posterior update checks, predictive checks, prior sensitivity checks, and parameter recovery. Finally, the results are discussed with a focus on model robustness and the influence of priors, and the number of trials on parameter estimation. 

### Project Organization
